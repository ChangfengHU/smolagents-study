Welcome to the Travel Planner!

- Tell me your destination, dates (or month), trip length, budget, pace, and interests.
- I will search the web to gather up-to-date info and craft a day-by-day plan.

Examples:
- 5 days in Paris in May, museums + food, mid-budget, relaxed pace
- 7 days in Japan (Tokyo/Kyoto) in October, culture + food, trains only

Notes:
- Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` or `GROQ_API_KEY` before starting.
- Web search uses public sources (DuckDuckGo), so details may change â€” verify key bookings.
